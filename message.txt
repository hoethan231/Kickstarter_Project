 0   goal                         20632 non-null  float64
    
        I am assuming that the goal currency is in their local currency, so we may have to convert them, we multiple each goal
        with the static_usd_rate. Therefore, all our currency is in USD rather than in different types of currency.
 
 1   pledged                      20632 non-null  float64
 2   state                        20632 non-null  object 
 3   country                      20632 non-null  object 
 4   currency                     20632 non-null  object 
 5   currency_trailing_code       20632 non-null  bool      
        
        We can prob delete that, we have to look into what that means
    
 6   staff_pick                   20632 non-null  bool   
 7   backers_count                20632 non-null  int64  
 8   static_usd_rate              20632 non-null  float64

        We are definately dropping that because we have the year the kickstarter was created and the pledge amount in USD.
        We will still use it but for like the models used later, we will ignore this model. 

 9   usd_pledged                  20632 non-null  float64
 10  category                     18743 non-null  object 
 
        There is some NaN (10% of data is mislabeled), so I am thinking we should label those NaN to something.
 
 11  spotlight                    20632 non-null  bool   
 12  state_changed_at_weekday     20632 non-null  object 
 
        This is prob useless, but I would want to see if there is any correlation with the "state" feature
 
 13  created_at_weekday           20632 non-null  object 
 
        This goes the same for the weekday and I want to see if there is any relationship between the weekday or something
        and the state of the kickstarter and perhaps if the kickstarter is successful or not. I really doubt there is any
        relationship between them but whatever.
    
 14  launched_at_weekday          20632 non-null  object 
 
        Again, same goes here.
 
 15  deadline_month               20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Maybe consider this and see its relationship of the state of the kickstarter?
 
 16  deadline_day                 20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Maybe consider this and see its relationship of the state of the kickstarter?
 
 17  deadline_yr                  20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Maybe consider this and see its relationship of the state of the kickstarter?
 
 18  deadline_hr                  20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Maybe consider this and see its relationship of the state of the kickstarter? For all the deadlines, I am assuming 
        there are unique deadlines specific for each country that could impact it. 
 
 19  state_changed_at_month       20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Prob this because looking at the histogram, it is basically all even throughout, there is no noticeable pattern considering
        the entire dataset. We could look at each country but I think that is irrelavent to know for our models.
 
 20  state_changed_at_day         20632 non-null  int64  
    
        Extra information. Can remove.
 
 21  state_changed_at_yr          20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Comparing the histogram between this and the year created, they are like one-to-one. I am thinking to drop this because 
        this is extra information we most likely do not need. 
 
 22  state_changed_at_hr          20632 non-null  int64  
 
        Extra information. Can remove. 
 
 23  created_at_month             20632 non-null  int64  
 24  created_at_day               20632 non-null  int64  
 25  created_at_yr                20632 non-null  int64  
 26  created_at_hr                20632 non-null  int64  
 27  launched_at_month            20632 non-null  int64

 36  TOPCOUNTRY                   20632 non-null  int64  
 
        I am not sure this means. 
 
 37  LaunchedTuesday              20632 non-null  int64  
 
        I have no idea what the column means.
 
 38  DeadlineWeekend              20632 non-null  int64  
 
        I have no idea what the column means.
